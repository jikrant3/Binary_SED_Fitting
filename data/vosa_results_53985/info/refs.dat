If your research benefits from the use of VOSA, we would appreciate if you could include the corresponding reference in your publication. Note also that VOSA makes use of models, VO services, etc that should be referenced too if they are relevant to your final results. Here you have a list of all the services that have been used for obtaining the results for this particular file. Please, take that into account. The refs.bibtex.bib file includes all the bibtex entries corresponding to the information below
