	Tables are provided with bolometric and absolute magnitudes on various photometric systems for an extensive grid of pure-hydrogen and pure-helium white dwarf model atmospheres. These include, in this particular order, the Johnson-Kron-Cousins UBVRI, Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) JHKs, Mauna Kea Observatory (MKO) YJHK, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 to W4, Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 microns, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ugriz, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) grizy, Gaia G, GBP, and GRP, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (Galex) FUV and NUV colors. These calculations can easily be extended to any given photometric system upon request.

	Stellar masses and cooling ages are also obtained for each model from detailed evolutionary cooling sequences appropriate for these stars. We use our latest generation of evolutionary sequences published in Bédard et al. (2020, ApJ, 901, 93) and provided below. We rely on stellar models with thick (qH?MH/M*=10–4) and thin (qH=10–10) hydrogen layers for the pure-hydrogen and pure-helium model atmospheres, respectively.

	Details of the color calculations are given in Holberg & Bergeron (2006, AJ, 132, 1221, "Calibration of Synthetic Photometry Using DA White Dwarfs"), which represent an extension of the earlier work by Bergeron, Wesemael, & Beauchamp (1995, PASP, 107, 1047, "Photometric Calibration of Hydrogen- and Helium-Rich White Dwarf Models"). For each set of filters, the files Table_DA and Table_DB correspond to pure-hydrogen and pure-helium model atmospheres, respectively. The DA grid covers a range from Teff = 2500 K to 150,000 K and from log g = 7.0 to 9.0, while the DB grid covers a range from Teff = 3250 K to 150,000 K and from log g = 7.0 to 9.0. At low temperatures (Teff < 5000 K and 8000 K for the DA and DB grids, respectively), we use the models of Blouin et al. (2018, ApJ, 863, 184), which include non-ideal effects. At high temperatures (Teff > 30,000 K and 40,000 K for the DA and DB grids, respectively), we rely on the models of Bédard et al. (2020, ApJ, 901, 93), which include non-LTE effects. At intermediate temperatures, we use the DA models of Tremblay, Bergeron, & Gianninas (2011, ApJ, 730, 128) and the DB models of Bergeron et al. (2011, ApJ, 737, 28). The DA grid incorporates the Lyman alpha profile calculations of Kowalski & Saumon (2006, ApJ, 651, L137). Tables are also provided at given masses for both DA and DB models through the files Table_Mass_*.
